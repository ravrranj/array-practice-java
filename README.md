# Add Program to Find Max and Second Max in Array

Overview
This Java program finds the maximum and second maximum values in an array. It helps you understand how to manipulate arrays, handle edge cases, and write efficient algorithms in Java.

Features
Efficient algorithm to find both the max and second max in a single pass.

Handles edge cases like arrays with fewer than two elements.

Written in pure Java with simple and easy-to-understand logic.

javac FindMaxAndSecondMax.java
java FindMaxAndSecondMax
Code Explanation
The program iterates through the array to find the max and second max in a single loop.

It uses two variables to keep track of the current maximum and second maximum values.

If a new max is found, the second max is updated.
